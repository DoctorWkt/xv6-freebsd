Incorrect ls output
-------------------
$ ls -l /dev
crwxrwxrwx     1 root root      0 Mon Aug 15 01:44:12 console
crwxrwxrwx     1 root root      0 Mon Aug 15 01:44:12 disk0
crwxrwxrwx     1 root root      0 Mon Aug 15 01:44:12 disk1
crwxrwxrwx     1 root root      0 Mon Aug 15 01:44:12 serial
$ ls -l /dev/console
	<no output>

less won't read stdin
---------------------
$ cat README | less
Can't take input from a terminal	# Using oldsh at boot time

But then 
$ cat README | less		# Works fine

Seems like there is an initialisation bug in oldsh. It's definitely oldsh,
as when I set wish to be the shell spawned by init, this doesn't happen.
