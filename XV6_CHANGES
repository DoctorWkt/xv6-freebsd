Changes to the xv6 Kernel
=========================

lseek() system call
-------------------
This is a major Unix system call and is used by many programs
and libraries, e.g. stdio.

Files affected (lines):
	syscall.c (+2), sysfile.c (+60), file.h (+4), syscall.h (+1)

ioctl() system call
-------------------
I've added ioctl() only to support tcgetattr() and tcsetattr()
on the console device, with recognised flags ECHO and ICANON.
This is to allow programs to put the console into raw mode, which
is needed by curses and editline. I agree that ioctl() is an
abomination, so alternatively tcgetattr() and tcsetattr() could
be made into system calls.

Files affected (lines):
	console.c (+40), syscall.c (+2), sysfile.c (+16), file.h (+1),
	syscall.h (+1)

time() system call and mtime in inodes
--------------------------------------
This is crucial to programs like make, and users like to see
timestamps on their files when they run ls.

Files affected (lines):
	fs.c (+6), main.c (+1), syscall.c (+2), defs,h (+1), 
	file.h (+1), fs.h (+1), stat.h (+1), syscall.h (+1)
	and a new kernel file: cmos.c (+121)

exit() and wait() exchange values
---------------------------------
This is crucial to programs like make and the change was minor.

Files affected (lines):
	proc.c (+7), sysproc.c (+4), trap.c (+2), defs,h (+2),
	proc.h (+1)

Arbitrary filesystem block size
-------------------------------
The code is set up to have arbitrary filesystem block sizes but
the wrong ATA commands were being sent to the hardware. The fix
was minor.

Files affected (lines):
	ide.c (+4), fs.h (+1)

	
Userland xv6 Changes
====================

+ The layout of the source code has been rearranged to have files
  grouped into kernel, commands, libraries, include files etc.
+ mkfs is now more generic, and it clones an existing directory
  and subdirectories into the filesystem image
+ init now lives in /etc and calls /bin/sh
+ sh now looks in /bin for executables
+ xv6 include files have been modified to have the defines
  and struct changes to implement all the above changes
