This is a port of original Steve Bourne shell from 1978.
I tried to make it the same as original as possible!
It uses sbrk for memory management.  On some C libraries
opendir uses malloc and last uses sbrk.  The program
tryreaddir.c check if opendir(3) uses sbrk(2).

If any library function uses malloc/free and last
calls sbrk we include also in sh malloc/free which
are independent of the C library.  See the files
mmapalloc.c and sbrkalloc.c files.  It is possible
to link also using:
	echo sbrkalloc.o > mlib
	rm sh; make
See also the file shfeatures.h

One can also link with stak.c written by Geoff Collyer.
This work is based on the Geoff port cited above.
