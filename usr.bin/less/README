This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".
The manual page is in less.man (nroff source in less.nro).

INSTALLATION:

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and 
   unpack it by running "sh" on the distribution file,
   if you have not already done so.

2. Type "install" and answer the questions it asks.
   This will generate a makefile.

   If you choose not to include some features in your version,
   you may wish to edit the manual page less.nro and/or less.man
   to remove the references to the appropriate commands or options.

   (NOTE: there are some pre-generated makefiles for
    various systems, named makefile.sys5, makefile.bsd41,
    etc. which may be used if you wish.)

3. It is a good idea to look over the generated makefile 
   and make sure it looks ok.

4. Type "make" and watch the fun.

5. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "less"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, type "make install".

If you have any problems building or running "less", 
suggestions, complaints, etc., you may mail to the 
author via USENET at:
	tektronix!nscpdc!convgt!mark
  or	ihnp4!nsc!nscpdc!convgt!mark

Note to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed
in double curly brackets {{ like this }}.
