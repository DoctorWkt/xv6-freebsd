/* The <stdarg.h> header is ANSI's way to handle variable numbers of params.
 * Some programming languages require a function that is declared with n
 * parameters to be called with n parameters.  C does not.  A function may
 * called with more parameters than it is declared with.  The well-known
 * printf function, for example, may have arbitrarily many parameters.
 * The question arises how one can access all the parameters in a portable
 * way.  The C standard defines three macros that programs can use to
 * advance through the parameter list.  The definition of these macros for
 * MINIX are given in this file.  The three macros are:
 *
 *	va_start(ap, parmN)	prepare to access parameters
 *	va_arg(ap, type)	get next parameter value and type
 *	va_end(ap)		access is finished
 *
 * Ken Thompson's famous line from V6 UNIX is equally applicable to this file:
 *
 *	"You are not expected to understand this"
 *
