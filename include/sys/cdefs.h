 * GCC has extensions for declaring functions as const (`pure' - always returns
 * the same value given the same inputs, i.e., has no external state and
 * no side effects) and volatile (nonreturning or `dead').
 * These mainly affect optimization and warnings.  
 *
 * To facilitate portability of a non-standard extension we define __pure
 * and __dead and use these for qualifying functions. Non-gcc compilers
 * which have similar extensions can then define these appropriately.
 *
 * Unfortunately, GCC complains if these are used under strict ANSI mode 
 * (`gcc -ansi -pedantic'), hence we need to define them only if compiling 
 * without this.
