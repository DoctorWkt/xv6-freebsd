.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fITar\fR is a POSIX-compatible archiver, except that it does not use tape.
It's primary advantage over
.I ar
is that the 
.I tar
format is somewhat more standardized than the
.I ar 
format, making it theoretically possible to transport 
\s-2MINIX\s+2
files to another computer, but do not bet on it.
If the target machine runs
\&MS-DOS ,
try
.I doswrite .
