.Sh NAME
.Nm du
.Nd Display disk usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm du
.Op Fl a Li \&| Fl s
.Op Fl kx
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm du
utility displays the file system block usage for each file
argument and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
The number of blocks are in the same units as that returned by the
.Xr stat 2
system call, i.e. 512-byte blocks, unless the
.Fl k
option is specified, or the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable is set (see below).
Partial numbers of blocks are rounded up.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.
.It Fl s
Display only the grand total for the specified files.
.It Fl k
The block counts are forced to be in 1K (1024 8-bit bytes) size blocks.
.It Fl x
Filesystem mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar file
is a symbolic link referencing an existing file, the file referenced
by the link is reported on instead of the link itself.
.Pp
Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
time per
.Nm du
execution.
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environmental variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, the block counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
