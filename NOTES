Introduction
------------
xv is a minimalist Unix-like operating system, inspired by 6th Edition Unix
and the Lions Commentary on 6th Edition Unix. xv6's purpose is to teach
students about the workings of an operating system.
Website: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html

xv is purposefully pared down from a real Unix-like system.
It only has these system calls:

chdir	close	dup	exec	exit	fork	fstat	getpid	kill
link	lseek	mkdir	mknod	open	pipe	read	sbrk	sleep
unlink	uptime	wait	write

Among the many things missing from xv6 are:
 - no users, every user is effectively root
 - no file permissions
 - no signals, job control, networking

Project Aim
-----------
The aim of this project is to give xv6 as much of a Unix library and run-time
environment as possible without altering the kernel source code. Examples:
 - add in ANSI C functions: strings, memory functions, malloc etc.
 - add in a Stdio library: fopen, fclose, printf etc.
 - regexps
 - simulate some syscalls calls with existing syscalls,
   or write dummy syscalls
 - port existing programs to provide a run-time environment

So far I (Warren Toomey) have taken much of the FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 header
files, library code and a few commands and made them compile on the system.

To Do
-----
In no particular order:

 - Modify the library code to correctly use the xv6 system calls

 - Write missing library functionality, e.g. opendir (DONE), more to do

 - Write dummy library functions

 - Compile more of the FreeBSD commands

 - Test everything to ensure that it works

 - DONE: Write a more functional mkfs so that a multi-level filesystem
   can be built, one that has /etc, /bin and friends

---------------------------------------------
Well, I've moved on from the Minix libc/runtime and switched to
FreeBSD 1.1.5.1. It's been easier this time around, with a few
obstacles. We now have a reasonably full set of C libraries
and many of the simpler commands from FreeBSD. I've got levee
and less to run, as well as my wish shell.

Now I'm trying to find a suitable Bourne compatible shell and a
simple nroff.

----------------------------------
Things have moved quickly. I found a real V7-shell that Geoff Collyer
had modified to compile under current systems, and I got that working.
I had some trouble finding an nroff, so I went back to 4.4BSD-Lite
and found one there. While trying to get nroff to work I found a few
bugs in things like lseek(2) and fixed them. I wrote my own man(1)
command, and I've populated the system with suitable man pages.

Thus, with a decent shell, editor, pager and document processing tool,
I think the project is complete. I know I should go back and fix up
all the compiler warnings generated by the old code, but I may not
get around to that.
