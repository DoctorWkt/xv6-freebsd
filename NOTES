Introduction
------------
xv is a minimalist Unix-like operating system, inspired by 6th Edition Unix
and the Lions Commentary on 6th Edition Unix. xv6's purpose is to teach
students about the workings of an operating system.

xv is purposefully pared down from a real Unix-like system.
It only has these system calls:

chdir	close	dup	exec	exit	fork	fstat	getpid	kill
link	lseek	mkdir	mknod	open	pipe	read	sbrk	sleep
unlink	uptime	wait	write

Among the many things missing from xv6 are:
 - no users, every user is effectively root
 - no file permissions
 - no signals, job control, networking

Project Aim
-----------
The aim of this project is to give xv6 as much of a Unix library and run-time
environment as possible without altering the kernel source code. Examples:
 - add in ANSI C functions: strings, memory functions, malloc etc.
 - add in a Stdio library: fopen, fclose, printf etc.
 - regexps
 - simulate some syscalls calls with existing syscalls,
   or write dummy syscalls
 - port existing programs to provide a run-time environment

So far I (Warren Toomey) have taken much of the FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 header
files, library code and a few commands and made them compile on the system.

To Do
-----
In no particular order:

 - Modify the library code to correctly use the xv6 system calls

 - Write missing library functionality, e.g. opendir (DONE), more to do

 - Write dummy library functions

 - Compile more of the FreeBSD commands

 - Test everything to ensure that it works

 - DONE: Write a more functional mkfs so that a multi-level filesystem
   can be built, one that has /etc, /bin and friends

--------------------------------------------
I've decided to switch from the Minix userland to the FreeBSD userland.
The main reason is that FreeBSD's userland is more coherent and complete
compared to Minix.

So far I've got the main parts of libc.a up and running, and some simple
commands.
