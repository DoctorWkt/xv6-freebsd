Introduction
------------
xv is a minimalist Unix-like operating system, inspired by 6th Edition Unix
and the Lions Commentary on 6th Edition Unix. xv6's purpose is to teach
students about the workings of an operating system.

xv is purposefully pared down from a real Unix-like system.
It only has these system calls:

chdir	close	dup	exec	exit	fork	fstat	getpid	kill
link	lseek	mkdir	mknod	open	pipe	read	sbrk	sleep
unlink	uptime	wait	write

Among the many things missing from xv6 are:
 - no users, every user is effectively root
 - no file permissions
 - no signals, job control, networking

Project Aim
-----------
The aim of this project is to give xv6 as much of a Unix library and run-time
environment as possible without altering the kernel source code. Examples:
 - add in ANSI C functions: strings, memory functions, malloc etc.
 - add in a Stdio library: fopen, fclose, printf etc.
 - regexps
 - simulate some syscalls calls with existing syscalls,
   or write dummy syscalls
 - port existing programs to provide a run-time environment

So far I (Warren Toomey) have taken much of the Minix 2.0 header files,
library code and a few commands and made them compile on the system.

To Do
-----
In no particular order.

 - Get the xv6 kernel to compile with the Minix headers, to ensure that
   the kernel and libraries use consistent values
   ==> No, on second thoughts, we should not do this. The xv6 folk will
   still want to print their book of code. We should align the xv6 files
   and the library code, but not force the xv6 code to include the Minix
   headers

 - Modify the library code to correctly use the xv6 system calls

 - Write missing library functionality, e.g. opendir (DONE), more to do

 - Write dummy library functions

 - Compile more of the Minix commands

 - Test everything to ensure that it works

 - DONE: Write a more functional mkfs so that a multi-level filesystem
   can be built, one that has /etc, /bin and friends
